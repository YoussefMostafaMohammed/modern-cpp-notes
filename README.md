# modern-cpp-notes

This repository contains my personal study notes, explanations, and practical examples for **Modern C++** (C++11–C++23).  
It is organized into several topics covering key areas of Modern C++ programming, including Object-Oriented Programming, Smart Pointers, Templates, and Value Categories (lvalues, rvalues, and universal references).  

These notes are meant to serve as a quick reference and learning resource, combining theory, practical code examples, and detailed explanations.

- **Smart Pointers**
  - `std::unique_ptr` (unique ownership)
  - `std::shared_ptr` (shared ownership)
  - `std::weak_ptr` (weak ownership)
  - Smart pointer internals and memory management
  - Practical usage and comparison

- **Templates**
  - Template argument deduction
  - Reference collapsing rules
  - SFINAE and advanced template techniques
  - Universal/forwarding references

- **Lvalue, Rvalue & Universal References**
  - Understanding value categories
  - Forwarding and perfect forwarding
  - Common pitfalls and best practices

This repository is continuously updated as I study Modern C++ concepts and refine my examples.

If you want, I can also **add a linked Table of Contents directly in the README** similar to the ones you already have in your notes, so users can click and navigate to sections in each markdown file. This makes the README interactive and much more user-friendly.

Do you want me to do that?
